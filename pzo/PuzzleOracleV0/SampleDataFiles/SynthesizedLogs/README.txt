[.\testLogs1]
  There are 10 log files (1 for each team), and about 530 entries in each log file.
  These are self-validating log files were generated by the PuzzleOracle using the -tdlgen 
  (test data log generate) cmdline option on October 10th, 2015. 
  There are the standard test pattern: 10 Teams (T1-10), 100 Puzzles (Puzzle 100 to 199).
  SELF VALIDATION: Team N solves puzzle M iff the last two digits of M is a multiple of N. 
  Thus we expect Team T1 to solve every puzzle, Team T2 to solve every
  2nd puzzle and so forth. Besides the solves, there are other attempts 
  that are incorrect/notfound/blacklisted. There may be multiple solves interspersed by 
  wrong answers in any particular team's log.
[.\testLogs2]
  These are 5 directories containing log files. Each directory represents a phase - so the
  logs in that directory can be processed as a single simulated thumb-drive swap/walk-over. They
  don't need to be processed in any partcicular order.
  When they are all processed they have the same self-validation scheme as [.\testLogs1] above.
  NOTE:  These logs are more authentic as they were generated by querying the oracle and logging
  the results (the earlier logs were synthesized direcly).
